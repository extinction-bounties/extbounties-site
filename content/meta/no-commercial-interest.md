*Extinction Bounties* is not and will not be monetized. We assert clearly and 
without caveat: we have never made, are not making, and do not intend to make 
any money from this project. That includes indirect forms of monetization, such 
as leveraging its ideas, aesthetics, or notoriety to seek jobs, funding, 
speaking gigs, or other opportunities.

This is not a startup. It is not a campaign. It is not a stealth pitch.

We make this declaration in parallel with 
[our request for anonymity](/meta/anonymity/). 
The two go hand in hand: just as we ask to be judged solely on the merits of 
the ideas, we also decline to derive any financial or reputational advantage 
from them.

Thank you for respecting the spirit of this stance.
