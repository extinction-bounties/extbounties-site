## Contact us

Questions, feedback, or media inquiries? Email us at [extinction.bounties@gmail.com](mailto:extinction.bounties@gmail.com) or for enhanced privacy [extinction.bounties@proton.me](mailto:extinction.bounties@proton.me) or reach out on [Twitter @ExtinctionBount](https://twitter.com/ExtinctionBount).

We do **NOT** download or open any attachments under any circumstances. If you have a PDF or other file containing text we need, please run it through OCR and paste the raw extracted text into your message.

### Secure Email Tips

If you yourself wish to remain anonymous, we recommend you email our ProtonMail address. Depending on your threat model, consider:

- Create a disposable ProtonMail address yourself.
- Use Tor or a VPN to mask your IP.  
- Avoid personal metadata - strip document properties before sending.  
- Paste all text directly into the email body (we do not download or open any attachments under any circumstances).

Please verify with your own research if this is a concern for you. Security begins in the mind.

## Source Code

Everything you see here is [publicly accessible on GitHub!](https://github.com/extinction-bounties/extinction-bounties.github.io).
Our entire editing history - including rewrites, mistakes, and retractions - is there too.  

We *do* accept pull requests and Github Issues, but please ask yourself before you submit them whether you want your username or identity to be linked to the project in that way. Some legalese:

**Contributions.** By submitting pull requests, patches, code, documentation, or other materials (“Contributions”) to this repository, you hereby grant Extinction Bounties and its successors and assigns a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, publicly display and perform, and otherwise exploit your Contributions in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed. You represent and warrant that you are the sole author of your Contributions (or you have obtained all necessary rights and permissions), and you waive all “moral rights” (or their equivalent) in your Contributions to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Contributions are irrevocably public and may include your username and/or email in commit metadata; if you are uneasy with that, please consider whether you wish to participate publicly.
