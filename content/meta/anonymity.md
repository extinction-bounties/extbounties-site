We publish *Extinction Bounties* under a persistent psuedonym so that the ideas,
striking as they may be, take center stage - not the author or authors behind
them. We politely ask readers, academics, journalists, search engine operators,
etc. not to investigate or disclose the offline identities of anyone involved.
Further we request that large scale archiving or dataset-building projects
exclude this site.

If you have questions, critiques, or collaboration proposals, please reach out
*only* via the contact methods listed in the footer. Thank you for honoring
this request.

[statement of no commercial interest](/meta/no-commercial-interest/).
