Imagine you toss a candy wrapper on the sidewalk—and instantly owe a **$1,000
fine**. But that fine doesn’t just vanish into government coffers. It goes
straight into the pocket of **whoever reports you first**.

This isn’t science fiction. It’s the heart of the **Fine‑Insured Bounty (FIB)**
concept, popularized by economist Robin Hanson in his landmark
[Privately Enforced and Punished Crime](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/privately-enforced-punished-crimehtml).
Unlawful acts trigger a hefty cash-based penalty, and that penalty funds a
healthy reward for private whistleblowers. Because
[insurers would quickly emerge](/side-topics/but-who-would-insure-a-criminal/)
to cover the fines, even penniless offenders can’t dodge the consequences.
Everyone—from your nosy neighbor to a cheap IP camera—becomes an eager lookout.

> “What if the hunted became the hunters?”

In our littering example, anyone who spots you can click “Report” on an app and
claim their slice of that $1,000. Suddenly, **littering looks as risky as
jaywalking in front of a cop**. On the flip side, it’s a no‑brainer investment
to install a $50 camera in a busy park: your $50 outlay can turn into dozens of
$100 bounties over a year.

So what happens next?

1. **Behavior changes.** Would‑be litterers think twice before tossing trash.
1. **Entrepreneurs move in.** Cleanup‑insurance pops up, selling coverage and
   vetting low‑risk customers.
1. **Self‑financing enforcement.** Offenders fund the very network of watchers
   who catch them.

That feedback loop is powerful—and, as we’ll see, it can apply to much more than
roadside trash.

In upcoming posts, we’ll dive into how this same mechanism could **turbo‑charge
AI safety**, turning every engineer, auditor, and competitor into a potential
whistleblower. We’ll explore the **economic logic**, the **game‑theoretic
twist** that makes conspiracies unstable, and the **real‑world hurdles**—from
collusion to global coordination.

Ready to see how the idea behind a $1,000 anti‑littering fine can help prevent
runaway AI development, dangerous gain-of-function research and more? Continue
