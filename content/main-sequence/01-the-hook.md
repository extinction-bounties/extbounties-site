Imagine a new law is passed: If you toss a candy wrapper on the sidewalk 
you instantly owe a **$1,000 fine**. But that fine doesn’t flow into 
government coffers - it goes
straight into the pocket of **whoever reports you first**.

How would your behavior change? Well, you'd probably be a lot less likely to
toss candy wrappers on the street in public places (not that you do!). 
You would be very careful indeed if anyone else was around to see it, even a 
close friend.

Is that enough? Plenty of places have security cameras - if
litter is found it would be trivial for whoever
watches the camera to rewind and find the person who threw it down. So even on
deserted streets near buildings, it's not in your interests to give 
J. Random Security Guard a $1,000 windfall. 

Now that you think about it,
a $50 IP camera pays for itself many times over if it catches even one 
litterbug. Who's to say people aren't setting up cameras *anywhere*
they think they might get a hit? You might think e.g. a secluded beach
would be immune, but not so fast - private watchdogs might prefer out of the way 
places so that they have less competition for the race to be first to report!

Suppose you're in a flat field, then, far away from everyone, without a
power line in sight - are you safe then? Consider: Basic fingerprinting kits
can be purchased on Amazon for just $25 apiece, and even professional ones are 
under $500 these days. True, you don't know exactly how reliable this is, or
how long such fingerprints last. But why take the risk? After all,
there's nothing in the law saying that it matters 
whether you threw that candy wrapper yesterday, a month ago, a year ago...

You see where this is going. Much like how an old lady might cruise her block
for cans and bottles to recycle *en masse*, so here does **the fine create a 
new market** - a market
you quickly realize is probably more clever and more all-seeing than
any police department could hope to be. Someone specialized in finding and
prosecuting litterers could make a six-figure income with less than ten
successful busts a month - pretty good for a gig with flexible working
hours, little upfront investment, and no need for a high school 
diploma.

**You solemnly vow to never litter again.** When a local business reaches out and
offers you a policy, $5 a year in exchange for covering 90% of your first
littering offense that year if it happens, you figure it's a worthwhile trade
for some peace of mind. After a few months, you suddenly wake up to the
realization that you haven't seen one piece of litter in town since the new 
policy began.

This isn’t fiction. 
It’s at the heart of the **Fine‑Insured Bounty (FIB)**
concept of criminal justice, popularized by economist Robin Hanson in his 
landmark essay
[Privately Enforced and Punished Crime](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/privately-enforced-punished-crimehtml).
Under an FIB regime, committing a crime puts you on the hook for a hefty 
cash-based penalty, and that penalty funds a healthy reward for private 
whistleblowers. 

Let's generalize a bit: We pass a fine-insured bounty law on crime X. 
What happens next?

1. **Behavior changes almost immediately.** Would-be offenders think twice 
   before committing crime X. We didn't have to spend *any taxpayer money* or
   hire any new cops to get this - it's already working!
1. **Entrepreneurs move in.** 
   - Anti-X *liability insurance firms* pop up soon 
     after, selling coverage and learning to vet low‑risk customers - because 
     their profit margins depend on it. (You can only afford to insure a $1000 
     fine at $10 a year if less than 1% of your customers commit it.)
   - While at first the bounties are reclaimed by ordinary citizens,
     *bounty hunters* specialized in the detection and prosecution of crimes
     quickly emerge as well.
1. **Self‑financing enforcement.** X-committers fund the very network of watchers
   who catch them, and some of these watchers become very skillful indeed at
   their job. In aggregate, these bounty hunters quickly drive the
   *detection rate* of crimes close to 100%, while also trying to minimize false
   accusations that take up valuable resources without a payout.

That feedback loop is immensely powerful. As we’ll see, it can apply to much 
more than roadside trash. 

We at Extinction Bounties think it might even be able to *save humanity from 
itself*.

In upcoming posts, we’ll dive into how this same mechanism could **turbo‑charge
AI safety**, turning every engineer, auditor, and competitor into a potential
whistleblower. We’ll explore the **economic logic**, the **game‑theoretic
twist** that makes conspiracies unstable, and the **real‑world hurdles**—from
collusion to global coordination.

Ready to see how the idea behind a $1,000 anti‑littering fine can help prevent
runaway AI development, dangerous gain-of-function research and more? Continue
