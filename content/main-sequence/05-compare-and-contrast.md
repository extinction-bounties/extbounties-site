Fine-Insured Bounties (FIBs) are a novel tool in the policy toolkit—but how do
they compare to other strategies proposed for keeping advanced technology
(especially AI) safe?

This post lays out a side-by-side comparison of FIBs with other incentive-based
approaches, highlighting where each shines—and where FIBs may offer unique
strengths.

### 1. **Traditional Regulation and Licensing**

Governments often rely on licenses, inspections, and fines imposed by state
regulators. This is the standard playbook for nuclear plants, financial
institutions, and airlines.

- **Strengths:** Clear authority, discretionary enforcement, legal precedent.
- **Limitations:** Slow, bureaucratic, often reactive. Under-resourced
  regulators may miss violations, especially in fast-moving fields like AI.

**FIB Core Advantage:** Private bounty hunters massively increase detection
pressure. The state doesn’t need to catch violations—anyone can.

### 2. **Whistleblower Reward Programs**

Existing frameworks like the U.S. False Claims Act and SEC whistleblower
programs already pay people for exposing fraud or misconduct. Of all the
programs listed here, this one is the most similar mechanistically to FIBs, and
its success should make us more confident in them!

- **Strengths:** Proven track record. Whistleblowers have recovered billions for
  the government.
- **Limitations:** Relatively low payouts (15–30%), and only apply in specific
  legal contexts.

**FIB Advantage:** Pays out close to 100% of the fine. Supercharges the
incentive and generalizes it to any violation of safety law.

### 3. **Liability Insurance (Without Bounties)**

Some proposals focus on requiring AI developers to carry insurance, so if
something goes wrong, victims can be compensated.

- **Strengths:** Encourages careful behavior; insurers have financial motivation
  to monitor clients.
- **Limitations:** Post-hoc compensation doesn’t prevent harm. Actors might
  accept low odds of disaster if they think they won’t be around to pay.

**FIB Advantage:** Preventative. You don’t need a disaster—just a rule
violation—to trigger the fine and bounty. This is obviously an important
property if you think one disaster is all we'll get. Plus, insurers stay
hypervigilant to avoid paying fines.

### 4. **Windfall Clauses and Taxes**

Voluntary or legislated pledges to share profits from transformative AI
developments (e.g., donating 50% of future AGI profits to the public).

- **Strengths:** Addresses inequality and motive to race recklessly.
- **Limitations:** Back-loaded. Doesn’t directly deter risky behavior before
  profits appear. In fact it may *incentivize* pushing to AGI faster, come hell
  or high water!

**FIB Advantage:** Up-front deterrence. No need to wait for windfalls—the system
intervenes before harms occur.

### 5. **Prizes and Grants for Safe AI Research**

Funding efforts to encourage safety breakthroughs: alignment methods,
interpretability tools, etc.

- **Strengths:** Positive incentives. Attracts talent to work on safety.
- **Limitations:** Doesn’t deter unsafe efforts—only rewards safe ones.

**FIB Advantage:** Works on the negative side of the ledger. FIBs punish bad
behavior while prizes reward good.

### 6. **Corporate Self-Regulation**

Some AI labs have created internal red teams, ethics boards, or pause policies
if certain thresholds are hit.

- **Strengths:** Fast to implement, flexible, industry-led.
- **Limitations:** Toothless if leadership is conflicted. Hard to trust without
  external accountability.

**FIB Advantage:** Externalizes enforcement. Even if a company’s internal
culture fails, outside actors can enforce public safety norms.

### Conclusion: Complementary, Not Exclusive

FIBs are not a silver bullet to all of life's problems, but they plug a key
enforcement gap. Where other tools rely on goodwill, regulators, or future
compensation, FIBs put powerful, immediate financial pressure on rulebreakers.

The best approach may be layered: licensing sets the rules, FIBs enforce them
with market-driven rigor, insurers monitor compliance, and prize funding
supports better safety tools. Each plays a role.

make sure we don't mislead you into thinking this is a panacea. Go on to
