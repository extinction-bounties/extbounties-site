"No. Absolutely not. *No*," Dr. Lee snaps, looking over the underwriter's draft
term sheet. "'Underwriter may remotely shutter the fermenter?' Really? Our CFO 
will never allow it."

Senior Underwriter Marcus, who studied alongside Lee many years ago, doesn't 
bat an
eye. "Dana, there is a clay lens breakout in Grid-7 North that could turn into
a solvent superhighway if your fermenter breaks. You could pollute 200 acres
of prime farmland," he says, leaning back, "and guess who would be on the hook
for it? Us. For you. For $4 million - conservatively."

Dr. Lee has just recieved an offer letter from Ecovault Organics, an 
agribusiness unicorn promising to "reinvent nitrogen fixation". The job comes
with the standard disclaimer in 99% of reputable firms in this industry that
she carry her own personal liability insurance before she can so much as swipe
in to the coffee room. It's about as normal to her as driver's insurance. 
Marcus, personally aware of Dr. Lee's brilliance in
hexazene polymer degradation pathways, waived the firt-time consultation fee
just to get her in the door at Tri-County Liability Underwriters. But Dr. Lee
is starting to get the feeling this isn't really about winning her business.

"You're already asking for a quarter of my paycheck,"
Dr. Lee mutters. "Least you could do is be nice about it."

A moment of silence. Marcus looks far into the distance. Then back at Dana. 
"Could you close the door, and pull the curtains, please?"

Under the banker's lamp Marcus takes out a small manila folder, simply labeled 
"ECOVAULT - CODE SIX".
A grainy drone image of earth-moving equipment lies beside Grid-7 North, outside
the permitted berm. A dated invoice shows a Foamcrete backfill with what both
of them can recognize as woefully inadequate chemical resistance.

"Oh my God," Dana mutters. If Ecovault's site prep is that sloppy *before*
production, what corners will be cut once the fermenter is humming at 24 bar?

"Now you understand *why* we're asking for a quarter of your paycheck," Marcus
says, eyes downcast. "We got these from our tipsters' desk in Carcosa. The CEO
himself authorized prepayment to the tipster to get his hands on the originals,
they're in our vault now along with about a dozen other documents."

Dr. Lee switched from sitting at the hardwood desk chair to lying on the old
linen couch in Marcus's office, and raked her memory over the coals. How could
she have been so stupid? How could she ignore the warning signs? They wouldn't
even show her lidar maps of the area she would be serving. The azoxy radical
detectors were developed in-house and were always "awaiting certification". What
competitive advantage could that possibly give? And let's not even talk about
the tri-containment sump debacle... 

"If you have all this information," Dr. Lee asked Marcus quietly,
"why haven't you come forward publicly yet?"

"We don't have enough proof for an open and shut case," Marcus said. "And -
we're not warmakers. Bounty hunting is hard work. We're just trying to be smart
about the risks we underwrite."

Dr. Lee felt a bittersweetness three months later, hearing Ecovault filed for
bankruptcy. The technology was genuinely novel and exciting, but due to their
execution (so she reasoned) insurers wouldn't touch any of their new hires
with a ten-foot pole without aggressive monitoring policies in place, which
meant new hires wouldn't touch Ecovault with a ten-foot pole either. After
the dissolution of the company, a small group from Tri-County Liability
Underwriters including Marcus and the CEO were rumored to have approached the
founder of the now-failed startup, and negotiated a clandestine exchange of the
bona fide evidence in their vaults for much more than they paid for it.
