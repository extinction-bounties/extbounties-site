"No. Absolutely not. *No*," Dr. Lee snaps, looking over the underwriter's draft
term sheet. "'Underwriter may remotely shutter the fermenter?' Really? Our CFO 
will never allow it."

Senior Underwriter Marcus, who studied alongside Lee many years ago, doesn't 
bat an
eye. "Dana, there is a clay lens breakout in Grid-7 North that could turn into
a solvent superhighway if your fermenter breaks. You could pollute 200 acres
of prime farmland," he says, leaning back, "and guess who would be on the hook
for it? Us. For you. For $4 million - conservatively."

Dr. Lee has just recieved an offer letter from Ecovault Organics, an 
agribusiness unicorn promising to "reinvent nitrogen fixation". The job comes
with the standard disclaimer in 99% of reputable firms in this industry that
she carry her own personal liability insurance before she can so much as swipe
in to the coffee room. It's about as normal to her as driver's insurance. 
Marcus, personally aware of Dr. Lee's brilliance in
hexazene polymer degradation pathways, waived the firt-time consultation fee
just to get her in the door at Tri-County Liability Underwriters. But Dr. Lee
is starting to get the feeling this isn't really about winning her business.

"You're already asking for a quarter of my paycheck,"
Dr. Lee mutters. "Least you could do is be nice about it."

A moment of silence. Marcus looks far into the distance. Then back at Dana. 
"Could you close the door, and pull the curtains, please?"

Under the banker's lamp Marcus takes out a small manila folder, simply labeled 
"ECOVAULT - CODE SIX".
A grainy drone image of earth-moving equipment lies beside Grid-7 North, outside
the permitted berm. A dated invoice shows a Foamcrete backfill with what both
of them can recognize as woefully inadequate chemical resistance.

"Oh my God," Dana mutters. If Ecovault's site prep is that sloppy *before*
production, what corners will be cut once the fermenter is humming at 24 bar?

"Now you understand *why* we're asking for a quarter of your paycheck," Marcus
says, eyes downcast. "We got these from our tipsters' desk in Carcosa. The CEO
himself authorized prepayment to the tipster to get his hands on the originals,
they're in our vault now along with about a dozen other documents."

Dr. Lee switched from sitting at the hardwood desk chair to lying on the old
linen couch in Marcus's office, and raked her memory over the coals. How could
she have been so stupid? How could she ignore the warning signs? They wouldn't
even show her lidar maps of the area she would be serving. The azoxy radical
detectors were developed in-house and were always "awaiting certification". What
competitive advantage could that possibly give? And let's not even talk about
the tri-containment sump debacle... 

"If you have all this information," Dr. Lee asked Marcus quietly,
"why haven't you come forward publicly yet?"

"We don't have enough proof for an open and shut case," Marcus said. "And -
we're not warmakers. Bounty hunting is hard work. We're just trying to be smart
about the risks we underwrite."

Dr. Lee felt a bittersweetness three months later, hearing Ecovault filed for
bankruptcy. The technology was genuinely novel and exciting, but due to their
execution (so she reasoned) insurers wouldn't touch any of their new hires
with a ten-foot pole without aggressive monitoring policies in place, which
meant new hires wouldn't touch Ecovault with a ten-foot pole either. After
the dissolution of the company, a small group from Tri-County Liability
Underwriters including Marcus and the CEO were rumored to have approached the
founder of the now-failed startup, and negotiated a clandestine exchange of the
bona fide evidence in their vaults for much more than they paid for it.

In our previous essay we focused on who pays the fine, who grabs the bounty,
and some of the more interesting interactions that fall out of that. We paid
special emphasis on how whistleblower-paid bounty mechanisms can effectively
detect and prosecute even *organized* crime, both in theory and in practice,
with some examples from the SEC's whistleblower program as well as the False
Claims Act. This is already a considerable improvement on the baseline.

Less flashy but arguably even more important for our purposes is the role of
the *private insurer* in a fine-insured bounty regime. Few individuals or
start-ups can leave tens of millions idle on a balance sheet just in case they
run the wrong side of a bounty hunt, so those who run a non-negligible risk 
often elect to buy insurance instead. Holding insurance may be
[required by law](/side-topics/insurance-mandatory-or-voluntary/), as in the
case of drivers being required to hold driver's insurance in the United States; 
or they may be
technically voluntary but required in practice to be considered a legitimate 
business, as in 
[aviation insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_insurance), 
[medical malpractice insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_liability_insurance#Medical_professional_liability),
[marine insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_insurance), 
[cyber insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_insurance), 
[nuclear liability insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price%E2%80%93Anderson_Nuclear_Industries_Indemnity_Act), or
[practice builder’s risk insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder%27s_risk_insurance).

The instant an agent, like Dr. Lee above, signs up for an insurance policy,
a professional player with real skin joins the battlefield, one that:

1. **Prices risks up-front:** Premiums rise or fall with how dangerous your
   activities appear.
2. **Polices clients continuously:** Every report, audit, or sensor feed that
   can lower expected losses boots profit, so underwriters actively look for
   red flags and warning signs well before cashing in on an accident. Indeed,
   "veterans" from whatever field of endeavor the bounty is aimed at would be
   highly sought-after assets for such firms, as in the case of Marcus above,
   precisely because their expertise makes the signals that much more valuable.
3. **Encourages innovation:** A large reinsurer might cover dozens or even hundreds
   of firms in a given niche. A single clever detection scheme which noticeably
   moves the needle can be rolled out firm-wide overnight and benefit all
   clients.

The result is a *distributed compliance network*, that scales faster than
any centralized regulator could hope to.

## Exhibit A: The unreasonable effectiveness of aviation insurance on making plane flights safer

Many people know that travelling by plane is, bar none,
[the safest form of travel out there](https://www.shawcowart.com/blogs/7306/what-are-considered-the-safest-modes-of-transportation),
by almost any metric you care to measure them by. On average one injury occurs 
every ten *billion* passenger miles flown, or every 400,000 round-the-Earth
trips. But it wasn't always this way. 
Aviation insurance underwriters routinely refuse to insure airlines unless they 
meet strict maintenance, training, and operations standards. 
Already back in 1968,
G. I. Whitehead Jr.'s seminal paper
[The Role of the Insurance Company in Air Safety](https://scholar.smu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2603&context=jalc)
found that risk‑based premium models led insurers to clamor for
technological improvements from airlines across the whole complex engineering
stack. Everything from straightforward engine improvments, to
"black boxes" recording flight and cockpit data, to
the installation of weather radar, to the ultra-reliable autopilots 99% of your
average flight runs on today is in part an invention created thanks to the
constant financial pressure these underwriters put on aeronautics engineers
to get their act together. 

Aviation is of particular interest to us here because the worst-case
scenario is truly catastrophic. The combined civil and regulatory financial
exposure for a 200 to 300-passenger airplane suffering catastrophic hull loss and
killing everyone on board easily exceeds $100 million. 
Even that sky-high number is
[orders of magnitude lower than where it should be, given modern estimates of the value of human life](content/side-topics/how-large-extinction-bounty/). Despite that, it still remains an extremely
credible risk which is so large it can only be averted via sustained and
profound efforts at *deterrence*. Even a 1% risk reduction is worth millions
to the airline industry, and that's for this situation alone - nevermind that
such improvements tend to reduce risk across the board for all kinds of lesser
accidents.

## The importance of skin in the game

A bounty hunter fundamentally makes money on finding people who have done or
ideally are currently doing bad things, proving they did so, and then taking
their money. Conversely, a liability insurer makes money on finding people who
*are not* currently doing and ideally never have done bad things, proving they
are and have not done so, and then taking their money. They are almost
opposites, save for one detail: **Your insurer greatly wants to keep the
relationship going.**

Insurance is a heavily competitive industry no matter where you find it. There
are a lot of nerds out there who love the idea of making money quasi-*ex nihilo* 
by simple virtue of being smart, objective, and consistent, and they flock to 
fields like this. Typical
underwriting profit margins are in the single-digit percentages. Even a 0.1%
increase in loss probability can dwarf this profit margin, if the expected cost
of the loss is great enough. Nassim Nicholas Taleb would call this "skin in the
game", and it is notably absent from traditional criminal justice approaches -
osome unscrupulous peacekeepers may even wish for *more* crime in their cities
so they can justify larger budgets from the state.

Before any policy is granted at all, an insurance underwriter operating
in a FIB regime would perform agressive vetting of their applicants. 
Fly-by-night operations will find it very difficult to get any insurance policy
at a rate they can afford unless they have very good reasons for being that way.

But this is just the beginning. As the insuerer-client relationship continues,
the insurer may well decide to press the client to help them sleep better at
night by e.g. implementing live telemetry, mandatory logging, and 
secure-by-design infrastructure. Depending on the insurer's percieved risk of
the client, these may be required to get a policy at all, or they might simply
allow the client to purchase a policy on more favorable terms - similar to how
life insurance agencies will often offer you a better deal if you submit to
a pre-offer checkup by a nurse. 

Such proactive monitoring policies also give the insurer a way to combat
[adverse selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_selection). Even if
you already know that the access logs your insurer is asking for will never
reveal anything troublesome, *the mere act of agreeing to share them* is a 
huge green flag in your favor. The insurer can now credibly move you out of
the "low-risk, low-certainty" group to the "low-risk, higher-certainty" group,
which gives you access to better rates. Done at scale, that "low-risk,
low-certainty" group eventually contains mostly people who are not agreeing to
these methods because they *actually do* have something to hide, and so their
premiums will go up. 

This feedback loop is one of those special little ways in
which insurers quietly nudge best-practices upon the vast majority of entrants
in a market - not with a hammer, but with a scalpel, bit by delicate bit.
