Humanity's biggest threats today don’t respect borders. 
[Runaway AI development](https://aisafety.info/), 
engineered pandemics, 
rogue nanotech — all of these are global 
risks, all of these are 
dependent on the development of novel technologies,
and all of these could be developed - at least in theory - by 
anyone, at any time, from any where.
Our enforcement systems remain stuck at the
national level. Treaties are slow. International law is weak. Policing
cross-border actors? Near impossible. And even if we could - how on Earth do
you stop *progress*, without destroying everything great about modern 
civilization in the act?

We think **extinction bounties** can solve both of these. An extinction bounty 
flips the script: instead of trying to punish offenders with state-led
enforcement, we use **insurance-backed monetary fines** and **open bounty
hunting** to create a global market for detection and deterrence.

Here’s how it works:

1. **Huge statutory fines** are levied on activities which pose 
   **deep existential risk to mankind** - for example, 
   training a new frontier AI model, or trying to develop a superbug in a 
   gain-of-function lab. 
1. **Anyone, from anywhere in the world, can earn a bounty** by giving evidence
   that leads to a successful conviction. The money they get is paid
   **directly by the victim to the bounty hunter**, similar to the 
   wildly-successful SEC whistleblower program.
1. Similar to how virtually everyone on the road has driver's insurance, a
   **private liability insurance industry** will quickly spring up for each
   extinction bounty, to protect e.g. ordinary software engineers from being
   falsely accused of advancing unsafe AI. And, much like driver's insurance
   policies do, if you start to act funny, **your premiums will spike**. If they
   keep you as a client at all.

This has three transformative effects:

- **Aligned incentives**: Insurers monitor their clients to avoid costly
  payouts. Bounty hunters race and innovate to catch violators. 
  Potential violators quickly
  realize a cushy job researching something that *won't* end humanity as we know
  it is still a pretty good deal, given the situation. 
  Everyone has an immediate, financial reason to keep humanity safe.
- **Built-in funding**: The fines pay for their own enforcement. The system
  doesn’t rely on taxpayer budgets, be they in Shanghai, Seoul, or San
  Francisco.
- **Easy international cooperation**: Multinational goals are like pulling teeth
  in the best of times. However, the highly-targeted, self-sustaining, and
  easy-to-motivate nature of this proposal makes that job as easy as it can be.
  It's the "lowest common denominator" of things even the citizens of (Insert
  Country Here) can agree are terrifying and need to be controlled.

Extinction bounties cost little, scale cleanly, can be adapted to wildly 
different governance structures, and avoid whole categories of problems 
inherent in traditional criminal justice systems. 
You don’t need to rewrite the penal code. The
vast majority of your populace won't even notice they're in place.

When the downside is
inconcievably large, we need enforcement that’s automatic, incorruptible, and 
fast. Extinction bounties may be the key to all three.
