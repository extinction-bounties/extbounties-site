title: 'Intellectual History of Anti-Humanity Thought' 
series: 'Side Topics' 
draft: false
---

Throughout history, a small but notable strand of thought has regarded
humanity’s demise not as a worst-case scenario, but as a potential good—or at
least not inherently bad. These **“anti-humanity” positions** generally take two
main forms:

- Some thinkers actively argue that the *end of the human species would be a
  good thing*, either for humanity’s own sake or in service of higher values
  (such as eliminating suffering or yielding to a superior form of life).
- Others, from perspectives like **moral nihilism** or **cosmic pessimism**,
  maintain that human extinction would not be a moral tragedy—perhaps even a
  relief—given their doubts about any ultimate meaning or value in human
  existence.

This review surveys prominent philosophers and intellectuals—from ancient times
to today—who have *advocated for or seriously entertained* such anti-humanity
stances.

We will encounter:

- Religious sects that renounced procreation,
- Modern pessimists who concluded non-existence is preferable to life,
- Ethical theorists who see virtue in voluntary extinction,
- And futurists who envision replacing humanity with post-human intelligence.

Each figure’s reasoning will be clarified, whether rooted in **metaphysical
views** (e.g., life as an evil or illusion), **ethical arguments** (e.g.,
preventing suffering or harm), or broader **cosmic perspectives** (e.g.,
humanity’s insignificance or replaceability).

## A Caveat on Unsafe AI

Extinction Bounties is interested in averting *catastrophic x-risks due to novel
technological developments in general*.\
The development of unsafe artificial superintelligence is our largest example,
but **there are others**, including:

- Superpathogens emerging from gain-of-function research,
- "Grey goo" scenarios from nanotechnology experiments.

The philosophical question of whether it would be good to *end humanity in the
abstract* applies to all such x-risks.\
Unsafe ASI, however, introduces a **thornier question** for some thinkers:
whether it would be desirable to *replace humanity* with something "better."

We oppose this as well.\
It is worth noting that arguments for replacement are not necessarily arguments
for extinction.\
For example:

> "Replacing humanity with AI would be good because AI would maximize positive
> qualia far beyond anything humans could achieve."

This is a **consequentialist argument** about improving the universe—not a
direct endorsement of ending humanity *per se*.\
Our concern is with arguments for humanity’s *termination*, not merely its
*supersession*.


## Early Precursors: "Better Never to Have Been"

The idea that non-existence could be preferable to existence traces back to
ancient thought.

In Greek mythology, the wisdom figure **Silenus** reputedly told King Midas that
the best fate for humans is *“never to be born at all,”* and the second-best is
to *die quickly*
([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/14/anti-natalists-childfree-population-climate-change)).

A chorus in Sophocles’ *Oedipus at Colonus* voices this same sentiment:

> *“Never to have been born is best, but if we must see the light, the next best
> is to return whence we came as quickly as possible.”*\
> ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/14/anti-natalists-childfree-population-climate-change))

Such lines, quoted by contemporary anti-natalists, suggest an ancient
intuition:\
that the **absence of life might be freer of suffering and evil** than life
itself.


During the Hellenistic era, the Cyrenaic philosopher **Hegesias of Cyrene** (3rd
century BCE) earned the nickname *“The Death-Persuader”* for teaching that
happiness is unattainable and that **death is preferable to life**.

According to Cicero, Hegesias’ book *Death by Starvation* so persuasively argued
for *non-existence* that several listeners committed suicide; Ptolemy II
reportedly banned Hegesias from lecturing in Alexandria as a result
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegesias_of_Cyrene)).

Hegesias’ extreme **pessimistic hedonism** held that, since lasting joy cannot
be achieved, the wise person’s goal should be *freedom from pain*—a state
ultimately achieved only by **escaping life altogether**.


Certain religious and mystical movements likewise espoused anti-worldly,
anti-procreative doctrines.\
For example, the medieval **Cathars** (12th–13th century) believed the material
world was the evil creation of a false god.\
They preached that souls are trapped in bodies through procreation.

Accordingly:

- Cathar “Perfecti” took strict vows of **celibacy**,
- Marriage was repudiated,
- Bringing new humans into existence was viewed as perpetuating spiritual
  imprisonment
  ([Encyclopedia.com](https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/bogomils-and-cathars)).

Their dualistic theology implied that the *human species should ideally die out*
to free divine spirits from the corrupt material world.\
Here, extinction was envisioned as a form of **spiritual purification**.


Non-Western philosophies also contributed proto-antinatalist ideas.

Ancient **Buddhism**, for instance, taught that all life is caught in an endless
cycle of suffering (*saṃsāra*), and the highest goal is to attain
**Nirvana**—the cessation of rebirth.

In Theravāda Buddhist doctrine:

> *“All births are births into the world of suffering; hence, coming into
> existence must be evaluated negatively.”*\
> ([PhilArchive](https://philarchive.org/archive/MORWIA-13v3))

While Buddhism does not call for universal extinction, its view that
non-existence is the ultimate release from suffering **rejects any inherent
value in continuing worldly life**.\
This theme—**that non-existence may be better than existence**—would resurface
secularly in modern pessimistic philosophy.

## Nineteenth-Century Philosophical Pessimism

In the 19th century, **philosophical pessimism** emerged as a formal movement in
Europe, with thinkers explicitly questioning whether life—and humanity as a
whole—has positive value.

The pioneer was **Arthur Schopenhauer (1788–1860)**, who argued that existence
is permeated by suffering because it is driven by an insatiable, purposeless
**Will**. Fulfillment is always fleeting; pain and striving dominate. Thus, for
Schopenhauer, *non-existence would be preferable to existence*.\
He wrote that the greatest philosophical recognition is that:

> *“It would have been better if we had never existed.”*\
> ([PhilArchive](https://philarchive.org/archive/MORWIA-13v3))

Schopenhauer believed that the **will-to-live** could be turned against
itself—through renunciation, celibacy, and asceticism—to bring the cycle of
generation to an end. He praised Buddhist and Christian monastic ideals of
denying worldly desires, including the desire to procreate.

However, Schopenhauer **stopped short** of advocating violent or imposed
extinction.\
In his view, human extinction (and ultimately the extinction of all life)
*would* be good, but could only be achieved **ethically** through voluntary,
gradual turning away from life: a universal adoption of "will-lessness"
([Blog of the APA](https://blog.apaonline.org/2022/11/08/pessimism-and-human-extinction/)).

Thus, Schopenhauer favored humanity’s extinction **in principle**, but only via
peaceful non-procreation and ascetic discipline—not coercion.


Building on Schopenhauer, other German pessimists made the case even more
explicitly that the end of humanity—and even the universe—is *desirable*.

**Eduard von Hartmann (1842–1906)**, in *Philosophy of the Unconscious* (1869),
blended Schopenhauer’s ideas with a speculative cosmic narrative.\
Hartmann suggested that as the "Will" underlying reality comes to self-awareness
in humanity, it will intentionally will its own **non-existence**.

He envisioned a future state in which humanity, having achieved maximum
satisfaction and knowledge, recognizes the:

> *“Vanity and emptiness of existence”*\
> and collectively renounces the will-to-live
> ([PhilArchive](https://philarchive.org/archive/MORWIA-13v3)).

Once the human race eliminates its will:

- *“All the will existing in the universe will disappear, and as a result, the
  universe itself will disappear.”*

In Hartmann’s philosophy, human extinction is the **penultimate step toward
cosmic salvation**—the annihilation of all reality, which he regarded as a final
liberation.\
Like Schopenhauer, Hartmann insisted this process should be **voluntary**—a
gradual quietus brought about by philosophical realization, not violence
([Blog of the APA](https://blog.apaonline.org/2022/11/08/pessimism-and-human-extinction/)).


Perhaps the most radical pessimist of this era was **Philipp Mainländer
(1841–1876)**.\
A disciple of Schopenhauer, Mainländer inverted the usual "will to live" into
what he called the **"will to death"**—a universal drive toward extinction.

In *Die Philosophie der Erlösung* ("Philosophy of Redemption," 1876), Mainländer
declared:

> *“Non-being is better than being,”*\
> making the will-to-die the **supreme principle of morality**
> ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Mainl%C3%A4nder)).

Mainländer taught that God *began* the world by committing metaphysical suicide
(splintering Himself into phenomena) and that all of nature is consequently **in
a slow process of dying**.

Mainländer argued that our ethical duty is to **aid this process along**:

- Refrain from reproduction,
- Accept and even embrace suicide (in some cases),
- Hastening the peaceful extinction of humanity and eventually all matter
  ([Aeon Essays](https://aeon.co/essays/what-are-the-moral-implications-of-humanity-going-extinct)).

Tellingly, Mainländer practiced what he preached—upon receiving the first
printed copy of his book, he stood on it and hanged himself, literally
*sacrificing his life for his philosophy*.

He envisioned an ideal **"final generation"** of humanity:\
a cohort that understands the truth of suffering, refrains from reproduction,
and **willingly fades into oblivion**.


Not all 19th-century philosophers who grappled with nihilism and human destiny
actually *advocated* extinction.

**Friedrich Nietzsche** sharply criticized the pessimists, even as he
acknowledged that a **"will to nothingness"** tempts humanity.

Nietzsche feared that if life’s value were denied, people might embrace
**nihilism**—even to the point of wishing for:

> *"a general nothingness" or "suicidal destruction of the species."*

But Nietzsche himself championed the **will to power**:

- A creative overcoming of nihilism,
- The forging of new values,
- The ideal of humanity surpassing itself through the **Übermensch**
  ("overman"), not simply eliminating itself.

He derided Mainländer as:

> *"The sickly sentimental apostle of virginity"*
> ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Mainl%C3%A4nder))

and regarded the urge for extinction as a decadent symptom to be **overcome**.

Nonetheless, the fact that Nietzsche felt compelled to wrestle so deeply with
the idea of **willed human nothingness** illustrates how seriously this theme
was treated among late-19th-century thinkers.

Other figures like **Olga Plümacher** and **Julius Bahnsen** continued the
**pessimistic tradition**, and the trope *"better never to have been born"*
would echo into the 20th century—both in literature and philosophy.

## Modern Antinatalism and Philosophical Pessimism

In the 20th and 21st centuries, “anti-humanity” ideas have been most closely
associated with **antinatalism**—the ethical view that procreation is morally
wrong.\
Modern antinatalists typically argue that coming into existence is a harm, and
that humanity should voluntarily **stop having children**, allowing the species
to die out.

One of the earliest explicit antinatalist arguments came from the Norwegian
philosopher **Peter Wessel Zapffe (1899–1990)**.\
In his 1933 essay *The Last Messiah*, and later in *On the Tragic* (1941),
Zapffe contended that human **self-awareness** tragically overreaches our
capacity for happiness.\
Humans evolved to seek meaning and immortality, yet the universe offers
neither—a condition that breeds existential despair.

To cope, humans use psychological strategies (isolation, distraction,
sublimation) to dampen their consciousness.\
Zapffe’s bleak conclusion was that humanity is a biologically *“over-evolved”*
species doomed to suffering, and that the compassionate solution is to end the
experiment.

He advocated that:

> *Humans should cease reproducing and “phase out” their own species.*\
> ([PhilArchive](https://philarchive.org/archive/MORWIA-13v3))

Zapffe proposed that mankind should *“delay reproduction below replacement
levels”* so that:

> *The human race will eventually die out.*

This extinction, achieved through voluntary childlessness, would be a
**tragedy** in one sense (the loss of all human potential) but a net **relief**
in another, as no future generations would endure the absurd predicament we
face.\
Zapffe’s ideas remained relatively obscure until they were picked up by later
pessimists and writers.

One author inspired by Zapffe is the contemporary horror writer **Thomas
Ligotti**.\
In his non-fiction book *The Conspiracy Against the Human Race* (2010), Ligotti
popularized philosophical pessimism for a broader audience.

Ligotti, drawing on Zapffe and Schopenhauer, maintains that consciousness is a
**cruel accident** of evolution, and that **optimism is a “conspiracy”** meant
to obscure life’s horror.

While not an academic philosopher, Ligotti explicitly endorses antinatalism and
flirts with the notion that:

> *Human extinction would be a positive outcome.*

He chillingly describes humanity as *“malignantly useless”* and suggests that
extinction would serve as the universe’s remedy for the blight of consciousness.

Ligotti’s and Zapffe’s reasoning is largely **metaphysical and existential**:\
they argue that since suffering and futility outweigh life’s modest joys, it
would be better if life as a whole simply ended.

This aligns with the broader current of **cosmic pessimism**, as articulated by
thinkers like **Eugene Thacker**, who emphasize the universe’s inherent
indifference to human concerns.\
In this view, the disappearance of humanity is not to be feared, but calmly
accepted as the logical end to a futile condition.

Another major branch of modern anti-humanity thought is grounded in **ethical
arguments about suffering and harm**.

Here, the leading figure is **David Benatar (b. 1966)**, a South African
philosopher who has become the most prominent defender of antinatalism today.

Benatar’s book *Better Never to Have Been: The Harm of Coming into Existence*
(2006) crystallizes the antinatalist position with a formal argument.\
He posits an **asymmetry** between pain and pleasure:

- The absence of pain is *inherently good*,
- The absence of pleasure is *not bad* (since no one is deprived of that
  pleasure).

Thus, bringing a person into existence guarantees suffering—a moral harm—while
not bringing a person into existence **harms no one**
([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2018/entries/life-meaning)).

In Benatar’s words:

> *“Our collective nonexistence would be positively good, since it would mean
> the absence of suffering, and the absence of suffering is good.”*\
> ([Aeon Essays](https://aeon.co/essays/what-are-the-moral-implications-of-humanity-going-extinct))

On the other hand, any happiness future people might experience is **not morally
required**—if they never exist, there is no deprivation.\
Thus, existence is always a **net harm** compared to nonexistence.

The ethical upshot is that **procreation is immoral**:\
it unnecessarily condemns individuals to harm, and the human species ought to
**stop breeding**.

Benatar advocates a peaceful, **voluntary extinction** via universal
antinatalism:\
if everyone chose not to have children, humanity would **painlessly fade away**
in one generation, eliminating future suffering
([Aeon Essays](https://aeon.co/essays/what-are-the-moral-implications-of-humanity-going-extinct)).

Importantly, Benatar does *not* advocate violent solutions:\
he distinguishes **voluntary extinction** from violent **omnicide**
([Aeon Essays](https://aeon.co/essays/what-are-the-moral-implications-of-humanity-going-extinct)).

His stance is rooted in **negative utilitarian ethics**—the minimization of
suffering is paramount.

As early as 1958, philosopher **R. N. Smart** had pointed out that pure negative
utilitarianism could imply that a benevolent ruler should painlessly **destroy
humanity** to eliminate all future suffering
([Utilitarianism.com](https://www.utilitarianism.com/rnsmart-negutil.html)).

Smart dubbed this the:

> *"Benevolent world-exploder"*\
> scenario—and labeled it *“patently wicked.”*

Benatar’s approach avoids the act of world-exploding, but **accepts the
result**:\
no people, no suffering, and thus a better world.

Benatar’s arguments have sparked extensive debate.\
Critics question whether the absence of happiness is really “not bad,” and
whether his asymmetry argument justifies abstaining from reproduction
([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2018/entries/life-meaning)).

Regardless, Benatar has undeniably brought serious philosophical attention to
the once-taboo question:

> *Is human extinction actually an ethical improvement?*

Alongside Benatar, other contemporary thinkers have floated similar ideas.

The American philosopher **Todd May** has recently contemplated whether human
extinction might be:

> *“morally justified,”*\
> in light of the harms humanity inflicts on other sentient beings.

In *Should We Go Extinct?* (2024), May highlights humanity’s **“crimes against
nature”**—including factory farming, ecological destruction, and the mass
extinction of other species
([Literary Hub](https://lithub.com/should-humanity-pay-the-ultimate-price-for-its-crimes-against-nature)).

He suggests that:

> *“The morally right thing to do”*\
> might be for us to **stop procreating** and **let our species die out**.

May calls this a form of **"moral hanging"**—a self-imposed sentence on humanity
for the enormous suffering it causes.

Although May does not celebrate human extinction, he argues that:

- Continuing to exist and reproduce **perpetuates enormous harms**,
- Our non-existence would **relieve suffering** for billions of non-human
  animals and allow Earth’s ecology to heal.

May’s line of thought combines a **pessimistic view of human nature** (humans as
incorrigibly harmful) with **sentientist ethics** (equal moral concern for
non-human creatures).

Thus, ending humanity becomes not only an act of mercy toward ourselves, but
also toward the broader biosphere.

This idea connects to the broader current of **environmental anti-humanism**—\
which will be explored in the next section.

## Misanthropy and Cosmic Indifference: Nihilism’s View of Extinction

Another category of anti-humanity thought does not necessarily *advocate* human
extinction as a goal, but rather views it with **indifference or resignation**,
grounded in nihilistic or anti-humanist philosophies.

Thinkers in this vein challenge the common assumption that human existence has
special value or that its termination would constitute a moral tragedy.

For example, the political philosopher **John Gray** (b. 1948) critiques the
Enlightenment notion of human importance.\
In his book *Straw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals* (2002), Gray
attacks **humanism** as a secular religion that irrationally enshrines humanity
at the center of value
([Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_Dogs_(book)#Reception>)).

Emphasizing an ecologically informed, Darwinian perspective, Gray argues that
humans are just another animal species, not the masters of nature.\
He approvingly cites **James Lovelock’s Gaia hypothesis**, which portrays Earth
as a self-regulating system that does not need (or benefit from) human presence.

Gray suggests that:

> *Humans cannot "save the world"—and the world does not need or care to be
> saved by us.*

He predicts that technology, driven by human ambition, will likely render the
planet increasingly uninhabitable for ourselves, even as life itself endures.\
Far from seeing this as a nightmare, Gray adopts a tone of cold acceptance, even
grim solace:

> *"Happily, humans will never live in a world of their own making."*\
> ([Ted K Archive](https://www.thetedkarchive.com/library/john-gray-straw-dogs))

If *Homo sapiens* were to vanish, Gray does not think any cosmic value would be
lost; rather, many other species would likely thrive
([Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/767491-long-after-the-traces-of-the-human-animal-have-disappeared)).

This is a stance of **cosmic indifference**—the notion that, in the grand
scheme, humanity simply does not matter.\
It is not that Gray *wants* human extinction; he emphasizes that humanity will
likely bring about its own downfall through its actions.\
In a sense, he philosophically prepares us for the possibility that the end of
humanity is **neither immoral nor deeply significant** in a universe that
carried on fine for billions of years before us—and will carry on after.

This cosmic perspective has powerful literary and scientific echoes.

The horror writer **H. P. Lovecraft** described a vast, indifferent cosmos where
humans are insignificant and fragile.\
Lovecraft famously wrote that humanity is:

> *"an infinitesimal germ on a little unimportant speck of dust."*

While not a philosopher, Lovecraft’s **cosmic nihilism** reinforced the idea
that human extinction would be *metaphysically inconsequential*.

Similarly, astronomers and scientists have long reminded us that human life is
likely a brief flicker in the universe’s immense timeline.\
The eventual extinction of *Homo sapiens*—whether through natural catastrophe or
self-inflicted disasters—is seen as a near certainty, given that 99.9% of all
species that ever lived are now extinct.

Some thinkers, like physicist **Sir Martin Rees**, discuss human extinction
calmly in the context of **cosmic evolution**:\
not because they wish it, but to place humanity's brief existence into proper
perspective.

**Moral nihilism** also intersects here:\
if one believes there are *no objective values or duties*, then human extinction
cannot be judged as inherently “bad.”

For instance, mid-20th-century existentialists like **Jean-Paul Sartre** and
**Albert Camus** grappled with the absurdity of a valueless universe.

Camus famously said that:

> *"The only serious philosophical question is whether to commit suicide,"*\
> essentially asking if continued human life—individually or collectively—is
> justified in a meaningless world.

Camus personally answered *yes*, advocating a defiant affirmation of life's
absurdity.\
However, a thoroughgoing nihilist could just as easily answer *no*, or simply
shrug.\
If nothing matters, then human extinction doesn’t matter either.

The Russian novelist **Nikolai Fedotov** once remarked, in a nihilistic vein:

> *"Really, it would be better if not a single living thing existed."*

Such extreme nihilism was typically expressed rhetorically or emotionally rather
than as concrete proposals.\
Nonetheless, it underpins the thinking of some anti-humanity proponents:

> *If life has no inherent purpose or value, and is full of suffering, why not
> wind down the senseless show?*

The Romanian philosopher **Emil Cioran (1911–1995)** exemplified this attitude.\
Cioran was an existential nihilist whose aphorisms dripped with despair.

In *The Trouble with Being Born* (1973), Cioran flatly states:

> *"Not to be born is undoubtedly the best plan of all. Unfortunately, it is
> within no one’s reach."*\
> ([PhilArchive](https://philarchive.org/archive/MORWIA-13v3))

Since we *are* born, Cioran mused, the next best plan is to organize life so
that no new births occur.

While he stopped short of advocating mass suicide, Cioran consistently asserted
that **existence is a mistake**—a "blunder"—and that **non-existence is the
supreme form of mercy**.

This is **nihilism shading into antinatalism**:\
an embrace of extinction, not via active destruction, but via **terminal
self-denial** rooted in profound metaphysical disappointment.

## Transhumanism and the Post-Human Aspiration

Interestingly, not all who welcome the end of *Homo sapiens* are pessimistic or
nihilistic—some are in fact optimists about what could come *after* humanity.

**Transhumanism** and **post-humanism** are movements that generally value
radically transforming human beings (through technology, genetics, AI, etc.).\
While most transhumanists value the continuity of *persons*—seeking life
extension, intelligence enhancement, and related goals—a few thinkers have
speculated that the *replacement of our species* might be desirable if it leads
to "higher" forms of intelligence or value realization.

The computer scientist **Hans Moravec**, a pioneer in robotics and AI, is one
such figure.

In his book *Mind Children* (1988), Moravec envisions a future in which human
consciousness is uploaded into machines and intelligent robots eventually
surpass biological humans.\
He explicitly argues that if our human species *evolves into or is succeeded by*
a population of intelligent machines, this should not be seen as tragic.

On the contrary, Moravec views this **"machine takeover"** as *potentially
positive—even desirable*
([Aeon Essays](https://aeon.co/essays/what-are-the-moral-implications-of-humanity-going-extinct)).

Moravec suggests that biological Homo sapiens might become obsolete, but if our
**mind-children** (AI descendants) carry on and exceed our legacy, it would
fulfill humanity’s ultimate potential.

According to Moravec:

> *"The extinction of Homo sapiens would only be a 'great tragedy' if it
> happened without any successor;\
> if we are replaced by superior artificial intellects, then our demise would be
> very good."*\
> ([Aeon Essays](https://aeon.co/essays/what-are-the-moral-implications-of-humanity-going-extinct))

In short, he *entertains (and even hopes for)* a scenario where humanity as we
know it is voluntarily phased out or transcended, giving way to a new kind of
post-human existence.

This is an **anti-humanity position in a futurist key**:\
motivated not by suffering or nihilism, but by a vision of maximizing
intelligence, complexity, or value.

One can compare this to a parent willingly sacrificing themselves so that their
child—who is “greater” in some sense—might thrive.\
In Moravec’s view, humanity could **gracefully hand off the baton** to
artificial beings who think faster, suffer less, and perhaps experience richer
forms of consciousness.

Philosophers and technologists have debated whether we *should* want such a
handoff.

Oxford philosopher **Nick Bostrom** has cautioned that an unaligned
superintelligent AI might *annihilate humanity*, an outcome he considers an
existential catastrophe.\
Yet even Bostrom, in a thought experiment, has described a possible future where
digital post-humans—or uploaded minds—look back on biological humanity as a
primitive phase.

Some ethicists in the **effective altruism** community have mused about whether
an AI that could create vastly more happiness (for instance, in simulations)
might theoretically justify sacrificing the limited well-being of current
humans—a troubling calculus that echoes the old "benevolent world-exploder"
idea.

These are usually **reductio ad absurdum** scenarios rather than serious
proposals.

However, there exists a strain of transhumanist thought—sometimes called
**Cosmism** or hardcore **utilitarian futurism**—which holds that what
ultimately matters is **not who carries value forward**, but simply that **value
(happiness, knowledge, creativity)** is maximized in the universe.

From that angle:

> *If clinging to the human species limits the growth of value, then phasing out
> humanity in favor of something "better" could be seen as ethically
> acceptable—or even good.*

Such views remain highly controversial and largely speculative.

Moravec’s stance is one of the clearest examples on record where a respected
thinker straightforwardly says:

> *Yes, humanity should perhaps bow out for the machines.*

It flips the usual terror of the AI apocalypse:\
instead of fearing *"the end of humanity,"* Moravec imagines it as a
culmination—\
**humanity deliberately transforming itself into a new post-biological form.**

This represents a rare **optimistic form of anti-humanity position**, distinct
from the pessimistic and moralistic strains described earlier.

## Environmentalist Anti-Humanism: Humans as “Cancer” of the Earth

A final notable context for pro-extinction sentiment is radical
environmentalism.\
Here, the argument is not about *metaphysics* or *universal suffering*, but
about the health of the planet’s ecosystems.

If humans are driving mass extinctions, climate change, and the devastation of
habitats,\
some environmental thinkers conclude that *nature would be better off without
us*.

This is often phrased in explicitly misanthropic terms—for instance, the idea
that humanity is a **"cancer"** or **"virus"** infecting Earth.

In the 1970s, as awareness of overpopulation and pollution grew, such rhetoric
became more common.

The Austrian writer **Thomas Bernhard**, in his novel *Gehen* (1971), remarked:

> *"The earth, on which there are no human beings, attained by gradual
> extinction, would be, needless to say, the most beautiful."*\
> ([PhilArchive](https://philarchive.org/archive/MORWIA-13v3#:~:text=human%20race%20is%20the%20cancer,Austrian%20novelist%20Thomas%20Bernhard%20writes))

This literary quote encapsulates the deep ecological wish to *see the natural
world restored to its pristine state, unmarred by human exploitation*—\
a romantic vision of a thriving Earth **after humanity’s quietus**.

While most environmentalists focus on reducing human impact (not eliminating
humans altogether),\
a fringe has embraced what is sometimes called **ecocentric anti-humanism**.

The **Voluntary Human Extinction Movement (VHEMT)**, founded in 1991 by Les U.
Knight, is a noteworthy example.

VHEMT’s slogan is:

> *"May we live long and die out."*

Its members advocate that everyone **stop reproducing entirely** so that the
human race will gradually age and vanish, allowing Earth’s biosphere to heal.

As the VHEMT website puts it:

> *"Phasing out the human species by voluntarily ceasing to breed will allow
> Earth’s biosphere to return to good health."*\
> ([PhilArchive](https://philarchive.org/archive/MORWIA-13v3#:~:text=beautiful,27))

This is essentially Zapffe’s idea repurposed for ecological rather than
existential reasons.

VHEMT couches its message in quasi-altruistic terms:\
it is *better for all other life on Earth if humans aren’t around*.

Unlike some extremist groups, VHEMT explicitly rejects violence and coercion; it
is an awareness campaign and personal commitment, not a plan for forced
extinction.

While VHEMT is often viewed with curiosity or humor in the media, it represents
a genuine ethical stance:\
that **human existence is environmentally costly and unnecessary**, and that the
kindest thing we could do for the planet is to bow out voluntarily.

More extreme are the *violent* or accelerationist expressions of
eco-misanthropy.

In 1989, an article titled “Eco-**Kamikazes Wanted**” appeared in the Earth
First! Journal, essentially endorsing **omnicidal actions** to eliminate humans
as a boon to Gaia
([Aeon Essays](https://aeon.co/essays/what-are-the-moral-implications-of-humanity-going-extinct)).

A shadowy group calling itself the **Gaia Liberation Front** later echoed this,
advocating the deliberate and complete extermination of mankind to save the
biosphere.

These positions remain far outside mainstream green thought and have been
strongly condemned by environmental organizations.

They illustrate how **valuing “Nature” over “Humanity”** can lead to a moral
inversion—\
where the survival of our species is seen as a *negative* rather than a good.

One individual often cited (infamously) in this regard is the Finnish deep
ecologist **Pentti Linkola (1932–2020)**.

Linkola was a conservationist deeply alarmed by overpopulation and industrial
civilization.

Unlike VHEMT’s gentle voluntarism, Linkola provocatively suggested authoritarian
measures to drastically **reduce the human population**.

He once said:

> *If there were a button that would kill millions of people instantly, he would
> press it without hesitation (even at the cost of his own life) if he believed
> it would restore ecological balance.*\
> ([Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Pentti_Linkola#:~:text=,millions%20of%20people%20would%20die))

In an interview, he remarked that a massive third World War wiping out much of
humanity would be:

> *“a happy occasion for the planet.”*\
> ([Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Pentti_Linkola#:~:text=,millions%20of%20people%20would%20die))

Such statements have understandably led critics to label him an **eco-fascist**.

Linkola argued that:

> *"The worst enemy of life is too much life."*\
> ([Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Pentti_Linkola#:~:text=,page%20122))

He blamed humanity’s unchecked growth for impending global collapse, and his
solution was **severe, enforced contraction** of human numbers and activities
"by any means possible."

While he did not explicitly call for total extinction—he imagined a small
remnant population living primitivistically in harmony with nature—his views
come close to treating human life as largely **dispensable**.

It is important to stress that these radical stances are *extreme outliers*.

Environmental ethics as an academic field does include **anti-anthropocentric**
perspectives, such as **deep ecology**, which holds that ecosystems and species
have value independent of human use.

Some deep ecologists—such as **Arne Næss**—encouraged dramatically lowering
human population and footprint, but not to the point of extinction.

Still, the existence of groups like VHEMT and thinkers like Linkola shows that:

> **When the locus of value shifts from human well-being to the well-being of
> “Nature” writ large, the worth of humanity can quickly diminish.**

In these frameworks, the end of humanity appears not as a nightmare but as a
**cleansing or healing event for the planet**.

This echoes ancient ideas—like the flood myth or apocalyptic purges—now reframed
in secular, ecological language.

## Conclusion

Across this survey, we have seen a wide array of motivations behind
“anti-humanity” philosophies—yet they converge on the notion that the
disappearance of humankind is *morally acceptable, desirable, or even
necessary*.

- **Metaphysical pessimists** (Schopenhauer, Mainländer, Cioran, etc.) hold that
  life itself is an evil or an error—often due to unavoidable suffering or the
  futility of desire—and thus welcome extinction as the final liberation or
  redemption from a cursed existence.
- Their reasoning is typically **axiological**: non-existence has *relative
  value* over existence (no pain is good; no missed pleasure is not bad).
- **Ethical antinatalists** (Benatar, Zapffe, and contemporary figures like Todd
  May) emphasize the real harms that existence entails—for both people and other
  creatures—and conclude that it is *kinder or more righteous to cease
  procreating*.
- Their arguments are grounded in **utilitarian/calculative ethics** or
  considerations of guilt and responsibility (e.g., humanity’s guilt toward
  nature).
- **Nihilists and cosmic indifferentists** strip away sentimental attachment to
  our species by asking us to view humanity from an external or cosmic
  standpoint—where our existence looks arbitrary and pointless
  ([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/archIves/win2018/entries/life-meaning/#:~:text=This%20survey%20closes%20by%20discussing,standpoint%20utterly%20independent%20of%20one%27s)).

From such a lofty perspective—what Thomas Nagel called *the “point of view of
the universe”*—one might judge that if Homo sapiens vanished, *little of value
would be lost*, especially if no consciousness remained to lament it
([Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/archIves/win2018/entries/life-meaning/#:~:text=perspective%2C%20an%20encompassing%20standpoint%20utterly,time)).

Finally, **transhumanist or post-human utopians** offer a peculiar twist:\
they *valorize* the end of humanity, not out of negativity toward life, but out
of a vision of something superior.\
For them, what matters is the continuation of **intelligent life or value**, not
the preservation of the *specifically human* form.

It is worth noting that these positions, while provocative, remain far outside
the mainstream valuation of human life.

Most cultures and philosophies hold the survival of humankind as a basic good—or
at least treat extinction as a grave tragedy to be averted.

Even many pessimists balk at the leap to actively desiring human extinction:\
for example, Schopenhauer and Hartmann envisioned suffering alleviated and
perhaps voluntary extinction far in the future, but they did *not* condone
murder or coercion
([Blog of the APA](https://blog.apaonline.org/2022/11/08/pessimism-and-human-extinction/#:~:text=adopt%20concrete%20steps%20to%20bring,Perhaps)).

In contemporary debates on **existential risk**, almost all
philosophers—including staunch utilitarians like **Toby Ord** and **Derek
Parfit**—argue that human extinction would constitute an enormous loss:

- They measure this loss in terms of billions of potential future lives never
  lived.
- The loss of future art, knowledge, and joy is regarded as incalculably grave.

The pro-extinction thinkers form a tiny minority dissenting from this consensus.

Yet, their arguments serve an important function:\
they force us to confront **uncomfortable questions** about the *value of human
existence*.

- Are we doing more harm than good—to ourselves, to other beings, to the planet?
- If life has no divine meaning, can we still justify its continuation apart
  from instinctual fear of death?
- Is attachment to our species perhaps a form of bias or sentimentality?

These are challenging questions with no easy answers.

What is clear is that the "anti-humanity" perspective, in its many guises, has
persisted as an undercurrent in intellectual history.

From ancient lamentations that it is *"best never to have been born"*
([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/14/anti-natalists-childfree-population-climate-change))\
to cutting-edge visions of humanity yielding to intelligent machines
([Aeon Essays](https://aeon.co/essays/what-are-the-moral-implications-of-humanity-going-extinct)),\
the idea that the end of the human story *could be a good thing* has been
repeatedly voiced.

Every advocate surveyed—**religious dualists**, **pessimist philosophers**,
**antinatalist ethicists**, **nihilists**, **transhumanist visionaries**,
**eco-radicals**—offers a distinct rationale.

Yet all challenge a core assumption:

> That humanity’s continued existence is an absolute, unquestionable good.

Whether one agrees or not, engaging with these grim or **unconventional
viewpoints** can deepen our understanding of humanity’s place in the cosmos and
the nature of value itself.

As we face global issues like climate change, artificial intelligence, and the
search for meaning in an increasingly secular world,\
the once-marginal question—*"Would it be better if humanity disappeared?"*—has
gained a haunting relevance.

These thinkers compel us to:

> *"Concentrate the mind"*
> ([Literary Hub](https://lithub.com/should-humanity-pay-the-ultimate-price-for-its-crimes-against-nature/#:~:text=,Remove%20Ads))\
> on what truly justifies humanity’s survival—and what, if anything, might
> ethically trump it.

In sum:\
While advocates of human extinction are few, and their philosophies often
unsettling,\
they form an **indelible part of the panorama of human thought**.

Their radical critiques remind us:

- The value of human life, taken collectively, is *not a given* but a
  *proposition* that must be defended.
- That robust defenses of human worth must survive scrutiny—not be assumed out
  of habit or fear.

If we can answer their challenge, we reaffirm the preciousness of humanity.\
If we cannot, the likes of Mainländer, Benatar, or May may continue to haunt our
conscience.

As philosopher **Simon Knutsson** has noted:

> Engaging seriously with pessimistic arguments—however extreme—can *"push and
> pull our considerations"* and ensure our optimism is not naive
> ([Aeon Essays](https://aeon.co/essays/what-are-the-moral-implications-of-humanity-going-extinct)).

In confronting the idea of a world without humans, we are truly prompted to ask:

> **What, if anything, makes the human project worthwhile?**

The answer to that question—if it can be given—will determine the fate of our
species.
