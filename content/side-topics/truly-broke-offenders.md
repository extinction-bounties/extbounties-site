title: "[alpha] What if someone cannot pay an extinction bounty they are guilty for?"
series: "Side Topics"

TL;DR: If someone is found guilty of breaking an extinction bounty fine,
and even after exhausting all other options still cannot afford to pay it back,
we at Extinction Bounties currently think ordinary jail 
is a fine fallback plan in lieu of the rest of the funds. Our primary interest
is in *deterring* smart, well-capitalized agents from performing research along
dangerous technological development vectors, and so we suspect bounty hunters
will still find it well worth their time to go after these people.
This topic is intricately related to the question of whether extinction bounty
liability insurance should be required by law or not, but 

In the original
[fine-insured bounty (FIB) criminal justice theory](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/privately-enforced-punished-crimehtml)
Dr. Robin Hanson states that he believes
[FIB liability insurance should itself be mandatory](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/requirelegalliabilityinsurancehtml),
and that in a system where fine-insured bounties are used for *all* criminal law
that
[the only crime that lands you in jail is the crime of being uninsured](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/bounty-hunter-blackmailhtml).
This makes a lot of sense for a totalizing system where the same legal liability
insurance company might protect you against a vast swath of crimes and
accusations.

However, **extinction bounties** as we describe them here are what economists
might call a
[keyhole mechanism](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2005/11/keyhole_surgery.html).
They are very narrowly targeted to the world's hardest problems,
 in the hopes of being as easy to actually draft
legislation for, get passed, and get international agreement on as possible.
As in many areas of design, the scope changes the implementation.
Because the scope is so much smaller, and because the vast majority of people
living today will never even get close to accidentally triggering one of these
extinction bounties, it really does seem like overkill to mandate them at a 
population level.

What about on a professional level? There is precedent here, in most states 
anyone driving on the road is legally required to carry driver's insurance.
What if we required, for example, all software engineers to carry anti-AI risk
liability insurance?

Truthfully, we don't see any "knockdown arguments" for one or the other side
here, mostly because of the characteristics of the populations we are dealing
with. Making the insurance mandatory would raise premium prices at the margin,
but those premia are likely to be small for the vast majority of people in the
first place, and just as importantly people smart and conscientious enough to
be working as employed software engineers or microbiology researchers tend to
have enough money to afford such things. But these very characteristics -
intelligence, conscientiousness, perhaps risk aversion sufficient to hold down
a full time job in the first place - suggest such people would take the risk
of accidentally getting swept up into an extinction bounty litigation seriously,
and purchase insurance sufficient to meet their fears anyway.

Either way, our original question for this topic was what happens to people if
they are found guilty, and after losing everything we can take and liquidate
from them - their job, their house, etc. - what happens? Smart, consientious,
employed people generally have a lot to lose, and they feel the pain of that
loss quite seriously. We think jail as a fallback solution would be a fine
deterrent for such people. Since these are well-remunerated and usually very
remote-friendly people, the posibility exists that they can pay back their
fines efficiently by working from jail, and they may even prefer this
themselves to spending e.g. 20 years in the slammer and then being tossed back
into a totally unfamiliar professional environment and forced to start from
scratch.
