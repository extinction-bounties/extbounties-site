## But Who Would Insure a Criminal?

The idea of paying whistleblowers hefty rewards from fines collected from the
very wrongdoers they expose sounds great in theory.  
But there's an obvious problem: not every wrongdoer is rich enough to afford the
fine—whether that's a [$1,000 fine for littering](/main-sequence/01-the-hook/)
or the kind of **multi-million-dollar fines** we at Extinction Bounties are
*really* interested in.

Our answer: **private insurers would quickly emerge** to cover the vast majority
of the population for whatever activities we decide to impose FIBs on.

If you're not familiar with how insurance works behind the scenes, however, this
leads to a very understandable question:

> **Who in their right mind would insure people against fines for breaking the
> law? Isn’t that like insuring someone against the consequences of their own
> crimes?**

At first glance, it seems bizarre.  
But surprisingly, there's a compelling economic logic behind this puzzle.

## Why Insurers Enter the Picture

In a FIB system, fines are designed to be very large—potentially huge.  
Without insurance, committing even a single violation (say, illegal dumping, tax
fraud, or unsafe AI research) could not only bankrupt an individual or company,
it could even land them in jail.

**Insurers spot an opportunity here**:  
They can offer protection against catastrophic financial loss in exchange for
premiums.

But here's the catch: insurers aren't naïve.  
They have zero incentive to protect reckless criminals. Instead, they behave
like highly sophisticated risk managers:

- **Risky clients pay higher premiums** — just like smokers pay more for health
  insurance.
- **Low-risk clients pay affordable premiums** — encouraging good behavior.
- **Extremely risky clients** — like someone stockpiling GPUs for illegal AI
  training — may be **uninsurable** at any price.

**Insurers become the ultimate private regulators.**  
To minimize their own risk, insurers actively:

- Monitor and audit clients.
- Impose strict rules and compliance programs.
- Conduct surprise inspections.
- Cancel coverage if clients refuse cooperation or act suspiciously.

If an insurer pulls away, bounty hunters immediately know to pay attention.

## A Self-Policing Ecosystem

This system naturally creates:

- **Rewarded good behavior** — safe, careful clients pay less and stay covered.
- **Prohibitively expensive bad behavior** — offenders are priced out before
  they can cause harm.
- **Privately motivated enforcement** — insurers act as watchdogs because their
  profits depend on preventing costly violations.

Importantly:  
Insurers **do not protect** criminals from punishment.  
They protect honest clients from ruinous accusations or rare accidents, while
**punishing dishonesty** through impossible insurance costs.

## Why It Works

The result is a **self-policing market equilibrium**, where:

- Most people comply voluntarily because it's economically rational.
- Bounty hunters are left to catch only the highest-risk or most reckless
  violators.

**Private profit motives**, not centralized surveillance, drive compliance.
