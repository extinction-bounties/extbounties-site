title: "The \"you can't stop progress\" fallacy"

Relative to the number of people who earnestly
[*want* humanity to end](/side-topics/intellectual-history-doomers.md),
a great many more people are convinced that humanity ending in the near future
by its own hand
is simply *inevitable*, so they'd better get used to it. This is what we call
the **"You can't stop progress" fallacy**: The idea that scientific and
technological development is like an ever-expanding balloon in all directions, 
unable to be directed or controlled except by the most low resolution methods.

**This is false.** Its falsehood can be seen by considering two very basic
principles:

1. Research has to be done by *someone*.
2. Economics predicts that if you make an action more expensive, that someone
   will do less of it.

We all understand this intuitively. If the United States government's head of
state woke up on the wrong side of the bed one day and decided to cut all
funding for oncology research, then oncology research would become much
more expensive for the companies and individuals pursuing it, and the rate of
progress would slow down. We can make this claim without ever wading into the
territory of whether this would be a "good" or a "bad" idea - it is simply a
matter of how the system works. If the USG's head of state woke up in a *really*
bad mood and decided anyone doing oncology research had to post *bail* or risk
losing their legal right to do so, the system would slow down even more.

Just as importantly, *the rest of R&D would be only minimally affected*. Yes,
there are certain interdisciplinary advantages that have to be ceded. But a
30 year expert on lymphoma is exceedingly unlikely to even talk to, say, a 
theoretical physicist,
let alone develop a novel theory with them that explains something that isn't
lymphoma but which happens to have strong analogies to it. **This is shaping
the balloon**. We already do it every day when we decide who gets and does
not get NSF grants.

Now research and idea generation does have one interesting characteristic: It 
is almost totally *non-excludable* in the long term. No matter how tight of a 
lid our lymphoma researcher keeps on his novel treatment with a 95% success
rate, someone, somewhere, will almost certainly leak what he learned to the 
public - even if it means they just discovered the same things independently
and decided to be less secretive about it. Once that happens, the cat's out of
the bag, right? We suspect *this* is why people really think you can't stop
progress: If it isn't you, it'll just be someone else, someday.

If you have read
[our pitch](/pitch.md), of course, you know that
**we don't agree with this either.** An economic mechanism which makes it
more expensive *globally* to do a certain kind of scientific research avoids
the non-excludability issue.
[You do not actually need international cooperation](/main-sequence/04-making-it-global.md)
to enforce this, although it makes the
process of enforcement easier. It is likely international cooperation on
such a "lowest common denominator" policy would come in its own time.
An economic approach also means that, if we fear that we are not slowing down
progress on undesirable vectors enough, we can simply ratchet up the economic
fines to rapidly disincentivize progress further.

**Yes, you *can* shift the Nash equilibrium away from performing dangerous
scientific research.** You can do so on a civilizational scale, and it doesn't
even have to be expensive. It simply requires that you push hard enough on the
powers that be, to get them to see the light of day and *do it*.
