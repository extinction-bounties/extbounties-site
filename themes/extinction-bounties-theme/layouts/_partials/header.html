    <p><em>Extinction Bounties</em> publishes <strong>theoretical economic and legal mechanisms</strong> intended to stimulate scholarly and public debate on catastrophic-risk governance.  
    The site <strong>offers policy analysis and advocacy only</strong> in the sense of outlining possible legislative or contractual frameworks.</p>
